These files are the data from the first round of diffusion coefficient tests, without turned-on dyes
coming back in. The analysis I did used 1e+03-1, 1e+06-1, 1e+07-1, and 1e+08-1.

These were runs meant to simulate Anuj's experimental trials in which he took data for 10 minutes every half hour.
The corrosion layer is run out for half an hour of real time, and then the solution layer run out, this loops several times
Information about time steps and parameters is saved in metadata files. I have not done any analysis on these
